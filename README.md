## Steps involved
### Preparing the data

1. Set a required physical volume size starting from the top (of the head) for the scans. Physical volume used is (450 x 450 x 300) mm3 in the (W,H,D) format. This size is chosen so that majority of the Head-and-Neck region is included. The generated bounding boxes of this size for each image are written in a CSV file. 
	```
	$ python cli_generate_bboxes.py  --source_dir ...   
	                                 --bbox_filepath ...  
	                                 --output_phy_size 450 450 300
	``` 

2. Crop the images according to their bounding box's physical coordinates and resample to the specified spacing/resolution. The voxel spacing used is 1mm x 1mm x 3mm, i.e. inplane resolution of 1mm x 1mm and a slice thickness of 3mm. A cropped+resampled version of the dataset is created and written on the disk. 
	```
	$ python cli_hktr_crop_and_resample.py  --source_dir ...  
	                                        --target_dir ...  
	                                        --bbox_filepath ...  
	                                        --new_spacing 1 1 3  
	                                        --cores 24  
	                                        --order 3
	```

Codename used for the outputs (and related items) of this step is "crFH_rs113" (cropped keeping Full Head, resampled to 1x1x3). The images thus obtained have a physical volume of (450 x 450 x 300) mm3 and an array size of (450 x 450 x 100) voxels.

### Patient Dataset
Derived from torch.utils.data.Dataset, used to return a sample patient dictionary containing full volumes, given an index.

Processing involved:

1. Smoothing 
	- Mainly for PET, to remove/reduce PSF reconstruction induced overshoot artifacts.

2. Intensity standardization  
	- 2 options: Intensity clipping or histogram standardization
	- Clipping for CT is set to [-150,150] HU and for PET [0,20] SUV by default.
	- Histogram standardization [[Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/836373) | [TorchIO implementation](https://torchio.readthedocs.io/transforms/preprocessing.html#histogramstandardization)]: Computing a mean histogram using the training samples, and distorting the histograms of the images to match this mean histogram using piece-wise linear contrast adjustment. To be done separately for PET and CT, obviously. 

3. Augmentation transform 
	- Spatial: Random rotation(+-10 degrees), scaling(+-15%), elastic distortion.
	- Intensity: Contrast stretching in PET between 30 and 95 percentile SUV range. 
	- One of these 4 applied with equal probability.

4. Rescaling intensities to [0,1] range
	Min-max normalization, where min and max values are obtained from the volume.

### Patch Queue
Custom code adapted from [TorchIO Queue](https://torchio.readthedocs.io/data/patch_training.html#id1) source code. The PatchQueue class is derived from torch.data.utils.Dataset and generates patch dictionaries given a patient dataset. Requires a custom patch sampler to sample valid patches from the volumes. Full volumes of the required number of patients as well as their sampled patched are cached. See the GIF on the linked page for working mechanism.

### Patch loader
Regular torch dataloader used to create and load batch of patches. Takes the patch queue as its dataset.
