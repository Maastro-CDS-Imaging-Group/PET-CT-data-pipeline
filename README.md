# Data exploration notebooks, conversion scripts and utilities for PET-CT data

## Steps involved

### Preparing the data

1. Set a required physical volume size starting from the top (of the head) for the scans. Physical volume used is (450 x 450 x 300) mm3 in the (W,H,D) format. Generate bounding boxes of this size for each image and store them in a CSV file. Codename used for the outputs (and related items) of this step is "crFH" (crop with Full Head).

2. Resample to a specific resolution. The voxel spacing used is 1mm x 1mm x 3mm, i.e. inplane resolution of 1mm x 1mm and a slice thickness of 3mm. Codename used for the outputs (and related items) of this step is "rs113" (resampled to 1x1x3).
