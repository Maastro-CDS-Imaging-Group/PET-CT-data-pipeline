- Option for setting type of sampling in Patch Sampler -- uniform sampling (implemented), sequential sampling (implemented), sampling patches that contain the GTV, etc.

x Add meshgrid for sequential sampling for both 2d and 3d samplers
x Implement focal_point_stride in patch samplers to enable setting the patch overlap amount. Test it.
x Test get_num_valid_patches() function  

- Testing:
	x Unimodality dataset
	- Histogram stdn transform
