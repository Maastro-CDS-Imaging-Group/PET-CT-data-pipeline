- Option for setting type of sampling in Patch Sampler -- uniform sampling (implemented), sequential sampling (implemented), sampling patches that contain the GTV, etc.

x Add meshgrid for sequential sampling for both 2d and 3d samplers
x Implement focal_point_stride in patch samplers to enable setting the patch overlap amount. Test it.
x Test get_num_valid_patches() function  

- Combine patch samplers into a single class

- Testing:
	- Histogram stdn transform

- Patch aggregator for inference
	x Test the aggregator in the notebook again, since the input dim ordering was changed. Test using Dice score too
	x Tested with no overlap handling, works
	x Fix 'union' overlap handing
	- Test 'union' thoroughly
